# Climate-Change-Prediction-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network
Ann Model that predicts Climate Change by comparing old weather forecasts with new weather forecasts.

A prediction system using a Deep Learning Weather Prediction model that predicts seven variables to compare future weather 
with old weather data to determine climate change. This model uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to produce forecasts.
irbid dataset is not used.
not all datasets have the same time intervals. 
The objective of this project is to accurately predict weather forecasts to determine climate change for different areas.
The model will predict the following features:
	1.Air Temperature.
	2.Humidity.
	3.Liquid Precipitation.
	4.Snow Depth.
	5.Horizontal Visibility.
	6.Wind Direction.
	7.Wind Speed.
